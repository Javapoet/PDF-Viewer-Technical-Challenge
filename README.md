# PDF Viewer Technical Challenge

## Challenge

Your challenge is to design and build a minimal vertical slice that loads and paginates a large PDF fast and smoothly, with a backend that serves content efficiently on AWS and a frontend that renders pages without blocking the UI. You will propose, refine, plan a whole feature, and execute an initial functional release. Use React and Node/TypeScript to develop your solution and ensure your solution is selfâ€‘contained and easy to run.
